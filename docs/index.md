# Exchange Toolkit: Copy-Paste Workflow for 3D and VFX

The **Exchange** toolkit simplifies data sharing between 3D and compositing applications by enabling a **copy-paste-like workflow**. Moving attributes, objects, or animations between apps like Nuke, Blender, and After Effects can be slow and cumbersome—until now.

With the Exchange Toolkit, you can **seamlessly transfer** cameras, 3D objects, and other attributes between applications **without the hassle of manual conversions or compatibility issues**. All tools use a **universal format** for exports and imports, so a camera exported from Nuke can be effortlessly imported into Blender, After Effects, or even back into Nuke. This consistency not only saves time but also ensures accuracy, making it ideal for iterative workflows and collaborative projects.

## Why Use Exchange Toolkit?
- **Fast and intuitive:** Copy-paste simplicity for 3D and VFX data.
- **Cross-application compatibility:** Works across Nuke, Blender, After Effects, and more.
- **Round-trip support:** Export from one app and re-import into another—or even the same app—without losing data.
- **Streamlined workflow:** Focus on creativity, not file conversions.



Each version is made to work standalone, i.e you can buy the After Effects version and the Nuke implementation, and then later you can get the Blender implementation and it will work with all apps. 


Availible to buy at gumroad and blender market.

Note that this is not a replacment for container formats such as USD, Alemebic etc. It's for quick and easy use. When exporting meshes between apps the standard formats are used.

As many parameters as possible are exported with animation. Note that some limitations between apps (i.e in Houdini you can animate the inner/outer radius of a Torus primite, but that is not availible in most other implementations)
