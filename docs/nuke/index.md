The Exchange implementation for Nuke supports both 3D and 2D nodes.

For 3D nodes the world position is always used which means it's easy to i.e export a camera with a parenting chain.

It's also worth noting that the Nuke implementation is very useful by itself (Nuke <> Nuke) workflow. For example for baking cameras,
converting 3d vertices to roto-nodes etc.
